## Release notes:

### build: 2019.03.21.1
   - added contactEmail and contactName for create user(s)
   - Updated access right requirements for create user and Add/Remove service subscription, now the service OR the user needs 'Manage Service Subscriptions'. If the service account has 'Manage Service Subscriptions' you are responsible for maintaining authorization for this feature.


## Overview 

The Service API provides a consistent interface for accessing data about the user, as well as the Veracity platform in general. At its core is a REST service built up of "view-points" where you can read, write and update information. Authentication is handled through Azure B2C OAuth 2.

## Api Management

You can access documentation and try out the api through the Api Management catalogue [Veracity Api management](https://api-portal.veracity.com/).
Note to existing Veracity developers, we will sunset the direct access to the api and you will only be allowed to access it through  https://api.veracity.com/veracity/services/ (latest) or https://api.veracity.com/veracity/services/V3/ (for version 3)

## Versioning

We are committed to keep 2 versions alive at any given time. We will only make a new version when we need to introduce breaking changes to our service, while extentions to the api will be released without adding a new version.

### Examples of changes without introducing a new version:

- adding a new action 
- adding new properties to the existing responses

## Authentication

Authentication is performed through OAuth2 bearer tokens.

### Service api subscription

To access the service you need to register your application in our api management catalogue [Veracity Api management](https://api-portal.veracity.com/) and pass your subscription key through the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

## View-points

The API defines three primary view-points from which you can access more detailed information. The base url for requests is:

```url
https://api.veracity.com/veracity/services/[view-point]

e.g.:
https://api.veracity.com/veracity/services/my/profile
```

These are:

|View-point|Path|Description|
|:---------|:-------|:----------|
|My|`/my`|Provides information about the currently logged in user.|
|This|`/this`|Provides information from the service or applications point of view, its capabilities and metadata.|

The view-points themselves do not provide information directly, instead you interact with them through defined **actions**. An action is just a string that you append to the end of the view-point path in order to perform a request. The actions follow normal usage of HTTP verbs with some minor exceptions.

### Responses

Each response provides all, or most, of these headers:

|Header|Type|Description|
|:-----|:--:|:----------|
|x-supportcode|string|Provides a unified way of correlating log entries accross all system components.|
|x-serviceversion|string|The api build number.|
|x-timer|int|The time spent on the server producing the response in milliseconds. |
|x-region|string|The Azure service region serving the request.|
|x-principal|string|The user the request was executed on behalf of.|
|x-view-point|string|The name of the current view-point.|
|x-actor|GUID|The user id of the actor/service account. |

The response status code describes whether or not the request succeeded. Currently,the following status codes may be returned:

|HTTP Status|Name|Description|
|:----------|:---|:----------|
|200|OK|Your request was processed correctly. View content for response.|
|204|No Content|Your request was processed correctly and no content was returned.|
|300|Ambiguous|Your request could point to multiple resources. You should augment it with additional identifying information.|
|400|Bad Request|The view-point/action exists, but the way you formatted the request was incorrect. Check `http verb`, `headers` or `body`.|
|403|Forbidden|The requester has insufficient permissions to perform the action or authorization information is missing from the request. Check that you provide a valid OAuth2 `Authorization` header.|
|406|Not Acceptable|Returned from the validate policy actions, the error body wil contain the url to the veracity accept terms page|
|404|Not Found|The requested resource/view-point/action was not found or is not known.|
|500|Internal Server Error|Something went wrong on the server when processing your request. Try to include the `x-supportcode` header content if you wish to submit a support request.|
|501|Not Implemented|The view-point or action is not currently implemented, but may be in the future.|

#### Response format

The API supports formatting the response body according to the mime type provided in your requests `Accept` header. Currently the following mime types are supported:

- `application/json`
- `text/json`
- `application/xml`
- `text/xml`
