# ISO 19847 and ISO 19848

ISO 19847 is a standard for shipboard data server or edge device, and contains minimum requirements for input and output interfaces, functionality, interfaces and performance. It also contains systematics for configuration, test requirements and environmental requirements tailored for maritime.

ISO 19848 is a data standard, defining the data structures and concepts that need to be used by the ISO 19847 data collector, but also relevant for other systems and shore-based platforms that will import and analyse such data. The standard defines data structures for “Tabular data” suitable for physical IOT-type measurements such as pressure and temperature as well as “Event data” suitable for asynchronous data such as alarm logs. ISO 19848 also defines a standard systematics for sensor naming and meta data.

One of the two allowed naming schemes are based on terms and codes from DNV-GLs Vessel Information Structures (VIS).

DNV promotes the use of ISO 19847 and 19848 and will refer to them in relevant class rules and guidelines. DNV offers certification services for data servers as well as infrastructure network elements implemented according to these standards.

From end of May 2020, Veracity supports ingestion of ISO 19848 data format directly from ships and from shore platforms.
