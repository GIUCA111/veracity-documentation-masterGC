# Provisioning of users
When users log in, they will automatically get a profile in Veracity, there is no need to provision users in advance. 

We plan to support user provisioning later, so that you will be able to upload users in advance and manage their permissions. This will be implemented through an API endpoint that will support the SCIM protocol.
