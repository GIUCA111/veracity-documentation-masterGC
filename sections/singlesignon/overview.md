# Overview of Single Sign-On with Veracity

We implement SSO by using the Open ID Connect protocol, and all configuration is pre-configured by installing the **Veracity Single Sign-On** app from Azure AD App Gallery. 

We also support SSO using SAML2.0, but that setup is a manual process that must be requested through [support@veracity.com](mailto:support@veracity.com).

Setup of SSO is free of charge. It will give access to log in with your company accounts to our Veracity platform and your users will have access to the free services on the Veracity platform. If your users want to use some of our paid services, they can buy a license for those in our [Veracity Marketplace](https://store.veracity.com "Veracity Marketplace").
