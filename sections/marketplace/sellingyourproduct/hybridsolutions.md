# Combinations
In both "One-column" and "Side-by-side" display options, you can configure a combination of variants of your product. 
For example, you can combine a free plan above a paid plan, or even add an extra variant of plan for users that have special needs, and show a “contact provider” button (1).

Also, you can show a plan with customized button (2) – which can link to an external website.
