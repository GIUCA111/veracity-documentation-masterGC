# Giving access to free services

## Purchase process for free services
If you want to give free access to an application or a data set, you can use the "Free access" button, as shown below.

You can add terms and conditions to free services so that the customer must approve them before they start using it.

## Delivering free services
Veracity enables the delivery of free services by:
* Giving customers immediate free access to applications integrated with [Veracity Identity](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/identity/identity).
* Handling immediate delivery of data sets. After you give the Veracity Marketplace necessary rights on the data container(s) in question, data will be made available for customers in “My data”.
* Providing an approval process that you can use before you give access to your free service. However, Veracity recommends that you give your customers immediate access to your service.

## Free services as an entry-level with upsell possibilities
You can give free access to your service as an entry-level for getting customers to start using a paid plan. You can sell premium versions or add-on modules as separate products on the Veracity Marketplace.
