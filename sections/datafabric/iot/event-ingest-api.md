# Ingest Alarms & Events to Veracity

Events and alerts are ingested into Veracity using API. 
- The api is accessible from [api-portal](https://api-portal.veracity.com/). 
- Select api: *Data Fabric IoT Event Ingest API*

Events are defined by event-types (templates) and Veracity allows ingest of any eventtype. If the eventtype used is not defined in Veracity, 
the ingested event will only be validated according to basic JSON validation.

A specialized event is the the equipment event that allows for topology inserts and updates as well as health status.

## Authentication
Authorization: Use bearer-token
See how to authenticate for the api [click here]( authenticate-api.md).

## Security Model
Only users (incl. application credentials) that has access to an asset can ingest data to an asset.

## Setup
Before data can be ingested to Veracity the following must be done:
1.	Vessel must be registered by Veracity administrator
2.	You must have access to the assets you are ingesting data for


## Ingest equipment event
This endpoint is used for adding new equipment, updating endpoint and update health status
- Base url: https://api.veracity.com/veracity
- Request url: https://api.veracity.com/veracity/ioteventsingest2/api/v2/assets/{assetId}/event/equipment?assetIdSchema={assetIdSchema}

- Authorization: Bearer token [click here]( authenticate-api.md)
- Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: from application client or B2C user

### query param
-assetId: asset imo nr or veracity guid
-assetIdSchema: imo/veracity  (the schema for the asset id)

### body
The body contains the JSON message in the following format

```json

  {
    "manufacturer": "string",
    "modelNo": "string",
    "serialNo": "string",
    "softwareVersion": "string",
    "type": "string",

    "name": "string",
    "timeStampUTC": "string",
    "healthStatus": "string",
    "expiryDate": "string"
  }


```

* dataChannelId: The equipment identifier /code used by the namingstandard used for asset categorization ( Vis code, mc key, JSME id etc.). This is the local id (ISO 19848) containing the namingrule
* name:Equipment name
* healtStatus: ok, notok - can be null (omitted) if event is a topology event 
* timeStampUtc: timestamp for event, UTC: format: "2021-04-06T14:22:48.950716+02:00"

```json
{
  {
   
    "healthStatus": "string",    
    "equipmentId": [
      {
       "dataChannelId": "string",
       "dataChannelId": "string",
       "name": "string",
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

## Ingest event by eventtype
This endpoint can be used to ingest any eventtype as a JSON object to Veracity with some paramerters in header. 
- Base url: https://api.veracity.com/veracity
- Request url: https://api.veracity.com/veracity/ioteventsingest2/api/v2/assets/{assetId}/event?assetIdSchema={assetIdSchema}&eventType={eventType}&dataChannelID={dataChannelID}[&eventId][&timeStampUtc]
- Authorization: Bearer token [click here]( authenticate-api.md)
- Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: from application client or B2C user


### Header param
- assetId: asset imo nr or veracity guid
- assetIdSchema: imo/veracity  (the schema for the asset id)
- eventType: event type (template/topic)
- timeStampUtc: timestamp for event, UTC: format: "2021-04-06T14:22:48.950716+02:00"
- dataChannelId: The equipment identifier /code used by the namingstandard used for asset categorization ( Vis code, mc key, JSME id etc.). This is the local id (ISO 19848) containing the namingrule
- eventId: optional. If not provided, a UUID will be generated
- timeStampUTC: option. If not provided, UTC.now will be used
