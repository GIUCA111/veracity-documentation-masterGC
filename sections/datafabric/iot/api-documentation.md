---
# Veracity IoT Api
The api is accessible from [api-portal](https://api-portal.veracity.com/). To group the endpoints in api-portal, select the "group by tag" button.
- Select api: *Data Fabric Time Series API V2*
- Base url: *https://api.veracity.com/veracity/

## Security Model
Only users that has access to an asset can access data from this asset.

## Assets
- Base url: https://api.veracity.com/veracity/

### GET Assets 
Returns all of the assets you have access to, for which timeseries data is available
- Relative url:  timeseries2/api/v2/assets

### GET asset by id
Returns the asset with specified assetguid if user has access to it and timeseries data is available
* assetId: asset guid
- Relative url: imeseries2/api/v2/assets/{assetId}

### GET DataChannelList
List all metadata for data-channels registered for this asset that the user has access to.  Inaccessible channels, based on permissions, are filtered out.
* assetId: asset guid
- Relative url: timeseries2/api/v2/DataChannelList/{assetId}

## TimeSeriesData Queries

- Base url: https://api.veracity.com/veracity/

### GET RawData - single channel
Returns raw data for given data-channel for given time period defined by before or after the offset. 
 * assetId: asset guid
 * dataChannelId: shortId of DataChannelUuid of datachannel.
 * offset: Relative point in time to either start from or end at the requested timeseries data. Date format using ISO8601 format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.  For example, "2007-04-05T14:30Z"
 * before: logical (true/false), if true then the timeseries will end at the offset, if false the timeseries will start from the offset.
 * includeOffsetBoundary: True/False. Include offset in query. Default is true
 * limit: Max datapoints to return. System limit is 200,000
 * header: true/false. Set to true if metadata is to be returned together with datapoints. Default is false.

#### Response as ISO 19848
- Relative url: timeseries2/api/v2/assets/{assetId}/dataChannels/{dataChannelId}/iso19848/timeSeries[?offset][&before][&includeOffsetBoundary][&limit][&header]
Response data is listed as EventData.

#### Response as flat structure
- Relative url: timeseries2/api/v2/assets/{assetId}/dataChannels/{dataChannelId}/timeSeries[?offset][&before][&includeOffsetBoundary][&limit]

### GET DownSampledData - single channel
If high resolution of data is not required or can be traded off for less dense data (and performance benefits) this is the recommended way of getting timeseries.
Essentially the timeseries is binned by the duration specified in the parameter and the min/max/average of the data per bin is returned.
Returns downsampled datapoints for given datachannel for given time period defined by before or after offset. The interval to downsample, is given in request payload. 
* id: asset guid

* before: logical (true/false), if true then the timeseries will end at the offset, if false the timeseries will start from the offset. Default is true
* includeOffsetBoundary: True/False. Include offset in query. Default is true
* limit: Max datapoints to return. System limit is 200,000
* header: true/false. Set to true if metadata is to be returned together with datapoints. Default is false.
* downScaleInterval: specify downscaling interval. Set to null if no downscaling. ISO8601 duration format. I.e. PT30S, PT1H, PT10M, PT60S
