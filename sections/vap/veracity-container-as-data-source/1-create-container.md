# 1. First you need to have a datacontainer

A data container is a storage brought to you by Veracity Data Fabric team.

It might be that your department/unit has a subscription for Data Fabric. Then you can ask that person to create the container for you. You can also contact Product Owner in Veracity that can elevate your access level to “Data Manager”. Allowing you to create containers and upload/download, etc within that subscription.

If your department/unit does not have a subscription, then that can easily be bought online on the Veracity marketplace. Please see the following link: https://store.veracity.com/veracity-data-fabric-secure-data-sharing

Help on Data Fabric can be found here: https://intercom.help/veracity/en/ This is the link you also find on Veracity.com in the footer called Help center.

If you need any help in addition to the description above I recommend that you contact the Product Manager for Veracity Data Fabric [Christian.Skjelbred@dnv.com](mailto:Christian.Skjelbred@dnv.com)
