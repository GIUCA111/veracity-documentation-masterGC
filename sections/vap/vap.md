# Veracity adapter for Power BI

We create your very own service on Veracity and you only need to create beautiful reports using Power BI. Create, upload, share or sell your insights. Your service can easily be enabled for Veracity Marketplace or just for sharing with your friends. Your data can sit wherever you want; locally, in the Cloud or in Veracity Data Fabric.

See the quick-start guide on how to get started.
