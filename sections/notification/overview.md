# Overview of the Veracity Notification service


## How does it work?
When your customers are using your digital service, they can also subcribe to notifications related to your digital service if the service is offering notifications.The customers can set their notification preferences. The preferences to set are:

- If they want to subscribe to notifications from a service or not
- How they want the notification delivered

We are offering delivery of notifications on different user interfaces/devices:

- Receive notification through web (visible in Veracity and in the web pages of the digital service)
- Receive notification through email, currently with frequency options of immediately, daily or weekly
- Receive push notification to a native mobile app that is related to a Veracity service
- Receive notification as SMS (this will be available in the near future)

The digital services can then use this notification channel to reach either all customers who subscribe to the channel or specific customers who subscribe to the channel.

Based on the customers preferences on how they want the notification delivered, Veracity wil deliver the notification.

If a digital service is offering different kind of notifications, these can be set up as separate notification channels so that the customer can subscribe to them independently.
