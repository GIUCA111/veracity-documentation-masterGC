# Veracity Notification

A notification is a short message to a customer telling them that you have some new information that you think is relevant for him or her to know. The notification can have links to further information or an action you want the customer to do but it should not be a lengthy text.

Examples:

- We just updated your container with the latest result data.
- A new DNV GL service specification (SE) Qualification of manufacturers of special materials(DNVGL-SE-0079) has been published.

A notification is not an action/task but some notifications could be notifying you that an action might be needed.

A notification should not be used as general information newsletters or for marketing purposes.
