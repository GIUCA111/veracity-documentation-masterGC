# API integrations

You can integrate APIs with Data Workbench. To do so, you need a service account.

## Add new service account
To add a new account:
1. In your workspace, select the **API Integrations** tab. 
2. In the left sidebar, select **Add account**. 
3. Enter the name for the account.
4. Select **Add**. 

After that, your account will be created, and you will get the values for the service account secret, ID, and API key. You will need them to [authenticate API calls](authentication.md).

**Note that** you will see the service account secret only once. Copy it and store it securely. 

## Update service account's name
To update the name of a service account:
1. In your workspace, select the **API Integrations** tab. 
2. In the left sidebar, under **Service accounts**, select an account.
3. Edit the name for the account.
4. Select the **Save** button.

## Regenerate service account secret
To regenerate a service account secret:
1. In your workspace, select the **API Integrations** tab. 
2. In the left sidebar, select a service account.
3. Next to the **Service account secret**, select **Regenerate**.
