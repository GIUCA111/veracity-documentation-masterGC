# User management

There are two roles for the users:
* admin
* reader

A user can only have one role. There must be at least one admin per workspace.

Workspace admin can:
* add users
* change users' roles
* remove users

If the user is not registered in Veracity, you will be prompted to invite them to Veracity.
