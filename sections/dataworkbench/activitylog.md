# Activity logs
Data Workbench logs the following events:
* Adding new user to Data Workbench.
* Changes to tenant (created, role added, role deleted).
* Changes to tenant members (invited member, member role updated, member deleted).
* Changes to workspaces (created, changed workspace description, role added, role deleted).
* Changes to workspace members (invited member, member role updated, member deleted).
* Changes to schemas (added, updated).
* Changes to schema versions (add schema version to schema, change default schema version of schema).
* Changes to data sets (created, modified, deleted, shared or revoked access).
* Changes to connections (created, modified, deleted).
* Changes to connector (created, modified, deleted).
* Changes to service accounts for API sharing (created, updated, regenerate service account secret, deleted).

To see the activity log for a workspace, go to the **Workspace** tab. Then, under the bar with an arrow, go to the **Activity log** tab.

## Filters
Filters are currently not supported, but in the future activity logs can be filtered by:
* Time range.
* Action performed.
* The user who has performed an action.
