# Veracity documentation issue guidance

Thanks for opening an issue in the Veracity technical documentation repository. 

We use GitHub issues as the primary channel for customer and community feedback about the Veracity documentation.

## Creating an issue

You can create a feedback issue here in the repo. If you do this, please make sure your issue lists:

## Pull requests and article contributions

If you know the change that is needed in an article, we encourage you to submit the changes directly using a pull request. If the change is large, or if you want to contribute an entire article, follow these guidelines:

- [ ] Don't surprise us with a big pull request or a pull request with a new article! Submit an issue that describes the details of the proposed large change or new article.
